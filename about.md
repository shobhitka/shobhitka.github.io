So, at last you found me !!!!! The one and only Shobhit. May you feel a state of complete nirvana on having found me :)

Well, I am just an ordinary guy currently based in Bangalore. I love listening to oldies from Kishore and Lata, play badminton sometimes and love working on Linux Kernel and Systems.

Just converted my site into Jekyll based blog. Wait for some more time to get it fully organized. Come back soon.
