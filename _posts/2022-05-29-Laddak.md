It was summer vaccation time again for kids and we wanted to plan a holiday that was memorable. We debated between Laddak and Andaman & Nicobar and finally settled on Laddak because we get a chance to visit extended family in North India. And hence started the planning cycle for the trip with my Bro Mannish who was as excited as me to visit this beautiful place. Contrary to as expected, it just took half a day on a weekend to plan the whole itinerary and another to make all the booking.

Since I was travelling with kids, I had few aprehensions

* How cold it would be and will my kids able to handle that
* how about low oxygen at low altitueds
* I have respiratory issues and was not sure it the cold weather and low oxygen will cause discomfort
* Do we get good hotels there, What about food and will kids be able to manage
* Pangong Lake is going to be toughest part of the trip with most cold and no proper accomodation

As we will see later, all were mostly unfounded.
