# Random Facts about me

I am a person with absolute perseverance to finish whatever I start with complete self conviction. I am a teacher and a student at the same time who yearns to share his knowledge and also learn from the experiences of doing so.

Solving complex problems excites me and there is never a chance I let go to be part of the solution. I like working in a team, but situational leadership comes naturally to me.

# Linux

I have been using Linux since 1997 by way of various Red Hat distros comming in computer magazine CDs to Debian, Ubuntu and more recently Fedora. I have been a Linux systems engineer ever since and have enjoyed every bit of the journey. Using Open source technologies give me satisfaction of participating in an open community. Currently I am working in Intel's Open Source Technology Center (OTC) in Bangalore, India. Have major focus on Intel's Gen graphics driver in kernel (i915) and Android Systems. One of the major contribution has been MIPI DSI support along with other [contributions in i915 kernel driver](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/log/?id=refs%2Ftags%2Fv4.8&qt=grep&q=Shobhit+Kumar) as author, reviewer and tester.

Recently I have started contributing to the [android-ia](https://github.com/android-ia) open source Android project from Intel as primary author/maintainer for the [bootable live installer](https://github.com/android-ia/bootable-live-installer).

I also like to play with various distributions and creating customezed distros for self and fine tuning the boot process.
